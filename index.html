        <h1>Welcome to the Wonders of Our Solar System</h1>
        <article class="space-article">
          <h1>Formation of the Solar System</h1>
          <p>
            Our solar system's story began around 4.6 billion years ago from a
            collapsing cloud of gas and dust, triggered by the shockwave from a
            nearby supernova. This event caused the cloud, known as the solar
            nebula, to fall inward under its own gravitational pull. As it
            collapsed, the cloud spun more rapidly and flattened into a
            protoplanetary disk with the future Sun forming at its hot, dense
            center. Around this nascent star, particles within the disk collided
            and stuck together in a process known as accretion, gradually
            building up the planets, moons, and other celestial objects we
            recognize today.
          </p>
          <p>
            An interesting facet of the solar system's early chaotic era is the
            hypothesis that additional planets may have once existed. These
            hypothetical planets could have been ejected from the solar system
            or collided with other bodies due to the unstable gravitational
            forces at play, underscoring the dynamic and often violent history
            of our cosmic neighborhood.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="space-article">
          <h1>General Characteristics of the Solar System</h1>
          <p>
            Our solar system comprises a diverse assembly of objects orbiting
            the Sun, which itself contains more than 99% of the system's mass.
            The movements of these objects are governed by their gravitational
            interactions with the Sun, resulting in elliptical orbits that vary
            in size and shape. Kepler's laws of planetary motion describe these
            orbits, providing a mathematical framework that explains how planets
            and other bodies move through space.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of habitability, Earth stands alone as a haven for life,
            uniquely blessed with liquid water, a protective atmosphere, and a
            suitable range of temperatures. However, other bodies like Mars and
            the icy moons Europa and Enceladus hold potential as they show signs
            of water, a critical ingredient for life as we know it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comparatively, our solar system is somewhat unusual. Many
            exoplanetary systems discovered in recent years feature large gas
            giants in close orbits around their stars, which contrasts sharply
            with our own system's layout where such massive planets reside in
            the outer regions. This difference offers valuable insights into the
            variety and formation of planetary systems across the universe.
          </p>

        <article class="space-article">
          <h1>The Sun</h1>
          <p>
            At the center of our solar system lies the Sun, a yellow dwarf star
            that is both a powerhouse and a stabilizer. It emits the light and
            heat necessary for life on Earth and governs the orbital paths of
            the solar system's bodies through its gravitational force. The Sun's
            surface is a dynamic and tumultuous place, marked by phenomena such
            as sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections. These solar
            activities not only affect space weather but also play a crucial
            role in shaping the conditions within the entire solar system.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="space-article">
          <h1>The Inner Solar System</h1>
          <p>
            The inner solar system contains the terrestrial planets: Mercury,
            Venus, Earth, and Mars. These are rocky, dense planets with solid
            surfaces and are primarily composed of silicate rocks and metals.
            Mercury, closest to the Sun, bears a barren, heavily cratered
            surface with temperatures extreme enough to melt lead. Venus,
            shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid, experiences the hottest
            surface temperatures of any planet due to its runaway greenhouse
            effect. Earth, our home, is uniquely hospitable, supporting a vast
            diversity of life thanks to its liquid water, protective atmosphere,
            and stable climate. Mars, with its cold, desert-like landscape,
            holds a record of ancient water flows in its valleys and dry lake
            beds, pointing to a more active past.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between Mars and Jupiter lies the asteroid belt, a collection of
            rocky bodies that marks the boundary between the terrestrial planets
            and the gas giants. This region is filled with remnants from the
            solar system's formation, offering clues to the processes that
            shaped the early planets.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="space-article">
          <h1>The Outer Solar System</h1>
          <p>
            The journey through the outer solar system begins with the gas
            giants Jupiter and Saturn, which are markedly different from the
            inner planets. Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a
            massive gas giant known for its iconic Great Red Spot and powerful
            magnetic field. Its numerous moons, like the volcanic Io and
            ice-covered Europa, make it a focal point of scientific study.
            Saturn is famous for its stunning rings, a dazzling array of icy and
            rocky debris that orbits the planet in a flat, expansive plane.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further out lie the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune. Uranus is known
            for its extreme axial tilt, which causes it to rotate on its side,
            leading to extreme seasonal changes. Neptune, the farthest known
            planet from the Sun, is noted for its striking blue color and
            dynamic atmosphere, which features the fastest winds in the solar
            system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond Neptune stretches the Kuiper Belt, an area filled with icy
            bodies, comets, and dwarf planets such as Pluto. This region serves
            as a gateway to the scattered disc and the hypothetical Oort Cloud,
            an immense sphere of icy debris believed to be the source of
            long-period comets that periodically visit the inner solar system.
            These distant regions represent the uncharted frontier of our solar
            system, holding clues to the processes that have governed the
            evolution of our planetary neighborhood.
